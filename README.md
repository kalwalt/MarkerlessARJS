Markerless AR based on https://github.com/ahmetozlu/augmented_reality
Trying to port the C++ code into javascript - WIP.

## Testing infos

The original project by Ahmet Özlü was developed in 2017 with OpenCV 2.4.10. I am trying to port part of the code to javascript with the emscripten transpiler.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV 4.1.0
- OpenCV_contrib 4.1.0
- Emscripten

I will provide pre-binaries for the OpenCV in a second moment of the development.
